# Arduino Monitor

This is a simple project to send usage information of your computer to your Arduino using serial communication.

## How It Works

A small and straightforward .NET application works as a server to send information to a usb-connected Arduino board.
The Arduino board is interfaced with an Hitachi-like 16x2 display in order to visualize the above mentioned information.
Moreover a LM35 is used to measure the air temperature inside the case, therefore it should be positioned properly.
